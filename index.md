## Welcome to OpenHTC.io

Welcome to OpenHTC.io, the place for the [High Throughput Computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-throughput_computing) [HTC] [Content Delivery Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network) (CDN).  HTC is the computing paradigm used by many open science projects, including the experiments of the Large Hadron Collider which has been a major force for the growth of the collaborations.  Computing for these projects is distributed throughout the world at many national laboratories and universities, and in many cases standard web technologies are utilized, including those that can benefit from the caching of CDNs.

OpenHTC.io is implemented very simply: using the free tier of [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com).  The first technologies cached are the [CernVM FileSystem](https://cernvm.cern.ch/portal/filesystem) and the [Frontier Distributed Database Caching system](http://frontier.cern.ch).  If anyone would like other services cached, please contact "support at openhtc.io".
